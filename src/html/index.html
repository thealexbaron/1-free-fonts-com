		<h1>What is a font?</h1>
		A font is a typeface, a set of characters comprised of unique shapes, curves, and angles. A font contains can be the characters that communicate a written language, or it can be a series of other random vectors.<br /><br />

		<h2>Why is selecting the right font important?</h2>
		Selecting the right font is critical. It can mean the difference between a persuasive ad, and an ad that a person will ignore. It can make the difference between a classy website and a 'homemade' website. If done properly, selecting a the right font for the right job will make your final work or product outshine competitors. <br /><br />

		<h2>Then how do I choose the right font?</h2>
		Frankly, there is no &quot;wrong&quot; choice, but there are some general guidelines that can be followed in the beginning before one begins completely on their own, choosing a font. The following are some guidlines in no particular order: The first guideline is <i>remebering that bodies of text should be in a font that is very legible.</i> No one will stay on a site that has unreadable text for the main content, regardless of how good it looks. While <a href="/fonts/category/arial">Arial</a> may seem overused and boring, don't be afraid to use it if you cannot find a completely readable font. The second guideline is knowing who your target demographic. If you're targeting all women, you may try <a href="/fonts/category/cursive">cursive fonts</a> in the logo. If you're targeting men, you may try a <a href="/fonts/category/chiseled">chiseled</a>, defined logo. These are simply suggestions. And, the third, and final suggestion is by far the most simple. Have fun. Be inspired and have fun with your selection!<br /><br />
